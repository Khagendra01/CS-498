      "content": "Click on the file assignment1.ipynb in this assignment.  \nThis is a jupyter notebook where you will add your code.\n\nDO NOT INCLUDE YOUR NAME/EMAIL ANYWHERE IN THIS FILE.\n\nIn this notebook you should add the following 6 cells with python code (plus additional markdown cells to document the assignment):\n\n  1. Create a class called Dog, such that any object of this class will have:\n    - attributes name, age, and breed\n    - methods talk, come, and sit\n    - when method talk is called, print `f\"{self.name} says woof\"`\n    - when method come is called, print `f\"{self.name} runs over\"`\n    - when method sit is called, print `f\"{self.name} sits\"`\n\n  2. Create a class called Cat, such that any object of this class will have\n    - attributes name, age, and breed\n    - methods talk, come, and sit\n    - when method talk is called, print `f\"{self.name} says meow\"`\n    - when method come is called, print `f\"{self.name} lazily meanders over\"`\n    - when method sit is called, print `f\"{self.name} gives you the a contemptuous look\"`\n\n  3. Create 2 different dogs (objects of class Dog) with different names, ages, and breeds; call the objects dog1 and dog2\n    - specify age in years, breed could be any dog breed (e.g., golden retriever, lab)\n\n  4. Create 2 different cats (objects of class Cat) with different names, ages, and breeds; call the objects cat1 and cat2\n    - specify age in years, breed could be any cat breed (e.g., briman, toyger)\n\n  5. Call the talk(), come(), and sit() methods for each of the 4 objects you created\n\n  6. Do the following 3 things:\n    - print the name, age, and breed for dog1 using the following code:\n      `print(f\"The {dog1.breed} named {dog1.name} is {dog1.age} years old now.\")`\n    - add 1 to the age for dog1\n    - print the name, age, and breed for dog1 again, using the same code:\n      `print(f\"The {dog1.breed} named {dog1.name} is {dog1.age} years old now.\")`\n\nAdd docstrings and comments (and/or markdown) where appropriate.\n\nCode will be evaluated for:\n- code is written and works as intended (e.g., correct calls, correct output, no errors)\n- clean/efficient code (e.g., no unnecessary code)\n- naming conventions (e.g., class names are UpperCamelCase)\n- readability (e.g., meaningful names, separation of code into separate cells)\n- documentation (e.g., docstrings, comments, argument type specification)\n- click \"View Rubric\" on blackboard under this assignment for more details\n\nExecute all cells in this notebook and save.\n\nSample output expected in this notebook:\n\n    Kobe says woof\n    Kobe runs over\n    Kobe sits\n    Spike says woof\n    Spike runs over\n    Spike sits\n    Jenna says meow\n    Jenna lazily meanders over\n    Jenna gives you the a contemptuous look\n    Sam says meow\n    Sam lazily meanders over\n    Sam gives you the a contemptuous look\n    The Labrador named Kobe is 5 years old now.\n    The Labrador named Kobe is 6 years old now.\n\n"
